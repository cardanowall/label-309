# Contributing to Label 309

Thank you for your interest in improving Label 309 — an open standard for
**Proof of Existence (PoE)** anchored on the Cardano blockchain.

Label 309 is a **working draft**, pre-1.0, and has been accepted into the formal
Cardano CIP process as [CIP-0190](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0190).
Contributions at this stage are especially
valuable: they shape a standard before it is frozen. This document explains
what lives in this repository, how to propose changes to the standard and its
machine-readable artifacts, and the discipline that keeps every reference
implementation byte-identical.

All contributions are made under the licensing and sign-off terms described in
[Licensing](#licensing) and [Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco).

## What belongs in this repository

This is the **home of the standard itself** and its normative,
machine-readable artifacts. Contributions here concern the wire format and the
materials that define and test it:

| Path           | Contents                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spec/`        | The normative standard prose.                                                                             |
| `cddl/`        | The canonical CDDL grammar for the on-chain record.                                                       |
| `schemas/`     | JSON Schemas for the record and its sub-structures.                                                       |
| `registries/`  | The extensible named-identifier registries (error codes; hash, KDF, signature, KEM, and AEAD algorithms). |
| `conformance/` | Canonical cross-implementation test vectors — the parity source of truth.                                 |
| `examples/`    | Small, runnable reference implementations in TypeScript and Python.                                       |

If your change touches the meaning of the wire format, the grammar, a schema, a
registry, or the conformance corpus, you are in the right place.

### What does NOT belong here

The **reference implementations** are maintained in sibling repositories. Bug
fixes, performance work, new SDK surface, packaging, and language-specific
issues belong with the implementation, not the standard:

- **`label-309-ts`** — TypeScript packages on npm: `@cardanowall/crypto-core`
  (primitives), `@cardanowall/poe-standard` (wire format), `@cardanowall/sdk-ts`
  (SDK + standalone verifier).
- **`label-309-py`** — Python SDK on PyPI (distribution `cardanowall-sdk`, import
  `cardanowall`); a byte-identical parity twin of the TypeScript SDK.
- **`label-309-rs`** — Rust SDK on crates.io (crate `cardanowall`); the Rust
  byte-parity twin.
- **`label-309-cli`** — the command-line tool on crates.io (crate
  `cardanowall-cli`, binary `cardanowall`); a standalone verifier and toolkit
  built on the Rust SDK.

If you are unsure which repository a change belongs to, open an issue here and
ask. A spec ambiguity that an implementation merely exposes is a spec issue; a
divergence between an implementation and the conformance vectors is an
implementation issue (the vectors are authoritative).

## Before you start

- **Read the spec.** Familiarize yourself with the five invariants the standard
  is built around — content-first, issuer-agnostic, storage-agnostic,
  standalone-verifiable, and algorithm-agile. A change that weakens any of them
  is very unlikely to be accepted; propose it as a discussion first so the
  trade-off can be examined in the open.
- **Search existing issues and discussions.** Your concern may already be under
  review.
- **Open an issue or discussion before a large or normative change.** See below.

---

## Proposing a change to the standard

Normative changes — anything that alters what a conforming record looks like,
what a verifier must accept or reject, or what an identifier means — follow a
discussion-first process:

1. **Open an issue or discussion** describing the problem and the proposed
   change. State which invariant(s) the change interacts with and why the
   change preserves them. For wire-format changes, describe the impact on
   existing records: the standard favors additive, backward-compatible
   evolution.
2. **Reach rough consensus** in the issue before opening a pull request for
   normative prose. This avoids large rewrites that have to be unwound.
3. **Open a pull request** that updates, together and in one coherent set:
   - the relevant `spec/` prose,
   - the `cddl/` grammar, if the record shape changes,
   - the affected `schemas/`,
   - the relevant `registries/` entries, and
   - **new or updated `conformance/` vectors** that pin the change at the byte
     level (see [Conformance-vector discipline](#conformance-vector-discipline)).

A normative pull request that changes the wire format but ships no vectors is
incomplete and will be asked to add them.

### Editorial and non-normative changes

Typo fixes, clarifications that do not change meaning, broken links, and
example improvements can go straight to a pull request without a prior issue.
If a reviewer judges that an "editorial" change actually shifts meaning, it
will be reclassified as normative and routed through the discussion process.

## Proposing a registry addition

The registries make the standard **algorithm-agile**: hashes, KDFs,
signatures, KEMs, and AEADs are referenced by stable named identifiers rather
than hard-coded, so post-quantum and future migrations are **additive**. The
error-code registry works the same way.

To propose a new identifier:

1. **Open an issue** titled for the registry and the identifier (for example,
   "Registry: add hash `…`").
2. **Provide a stable public reference.** The algorithm must be a named, vetted
   primitive with a permanent, citable specification — an RFC, a NIST FIPS or
   SP publication, a CFRG document, or an equivalent standards-track source.
   Bespoke, unpublished, or proprietary algorithms are not accepted.
3. **Justify the addition.** Explain the gap the identifier fills and why an
   existing registered identifier does not serve. New entries are added because
   they are needed, not pre-emptively.
4. **Specify it completely.** Give the exact identifier string, parameter sizes
   (digest length, key/nonce/tag sizes, security level, and so on), and any
   encoding rules a conforming implementation needs.
5. **Additive only.** Registered identifiers are not redefined or removed once
   published; an identifier may be marked deprecated, but its meaning is
   permanent so that old records remain verifiable forever. Deprecation is a
   spec change, not a deletion.

A registry pull request updates the registry file, the spec prose that
references it where applicable, and conformance vectors exercising the new
identifier so every implementation can prove byte-parity support for it.

## Conformance-vector discipline

Cross-implementation **byte-parity** is a core guarantee of Label 309: the
TypeScript, Python, and Rust SDKs produce and accept byte-identical output for
the same inputs, validated against the **same canonical conformance vectors**
in `conformance/`. The vectors — not any one implementation — are the source of
truth for behavior.

This imposes one rule on every wire-affecting change:

> **Any change to the wire format ships with byte-pinned conformance vectors in
> the same pull request.**

Concretely:

- A vector pins exact inputs to exact canonical-CBOR output bytes (and, for
  validation cases, to an exact accept/reject outcome and error code).
- New behavior adds new vectors; changed behavior updates the affected vectors
  and explains the change in the pull request description.
- Vectors are data under the code license (see [Licensing](#licensing)) so that
  every implementation can vendor and run them.
- A change that alters canonical bytes without updating vectors will desynchronize
  the implementations and will not be merged.

When in doubt, add a vector. The cost of an extra vector is negligible; the
cost of an implementation drifting from the standard is not.

---

## Building and testing the examples

The `examples/` directory holds small, runnable reference implementations that
demonstrate publishing and verification against the canonical vectors. They are
intentionally minimal and dependency-light.

- **TypeScript** (`examples/typescript/`): a recent LTS Node.js and a package
  manager. Install dependencies and run the example's test or start script as
  described in that directory's README.
- **Python** (`examples/python/`): a currently supported CPython. Create a
  virtual environment, install the example's dependencies, and run its tests as
  described in that directory's README.

Both examples are expected to validate against the vectors in `conformance/`.
If you change a vector, run both examples to confirm they still pass; if they
do not, either the vector or the example is wrong, and the pull request must
resolve which.

## Pull request checklist

Before opening a pull request, confirm:

- [ ] The change is in the right repository (standard vs. an SDK repo).
- [ ] Normative changes were discussed in an issue first and reached rough
      consensus.
- [ ] Spec prose, CDDL, schemas, and registries are updated together and agree
      with each other.
- [ ] Wire-affecting changes include new or updated byte-pinned conformance
      vectors.
- [ ] The TypeScript and Python examples still pass against the vectors.
- [ ] Every commit is signed off (see DCO below).
- [ ] The change preserves the five invariants, or the pull request explains
      and justifies the deviation.

---

## Style and house rules

- Write for an audience implementing the standard independently. Prose must be
  precise and self-contained; a reader should never need a private document to
  understand a requirement.
- Keep the standards-track materials **vendor-neutral**. The standard does not
  depend on, and must not be written around, any particular hosted service,
  company, or product.
- Cite only stable, public references — RFCs, CIPs at a permanent address,
  NIST/FIPS publications, BIPs, and the like.
