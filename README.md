# Label 309 — Proof of Existence on Cardano

Label 309 is an open standard for **Proof of Existence (PoE)** anchored on the
Cardano blockchain. A publisher hashes content and records the digest — together
with optional metadata — on-chain under transaction **metadata label 309**.
Anyone holding the resulting transaction reference can later prove that _this
content existed on or before the block time_ — without trusting the publisher,
their domain, or any server.

This repository is the reference home of the standard: the normative
specification, the canonical grammar and schemas, the extensible identifier
registries, and the cross-implementation conformance vectors.

## Status

**Working draft — pre-1.0.** Label 309 has been accepted into the Cardano CIP
repository as [CIP-0190](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0190)
(CIP lifecycle status: Proposed). This repository remains the reference home for
the standard. The wire format and registries are stabilizing; expect refinement
before a 1.0 release. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what has changed.

## What Label 309 is

A PoE record is a small, canonically encoded structure carried in a Cardano
transaction's metadata under label 309. Its primary claim is a **content hash**:
the digest of some piece of content the publisher wishes to timestamp. Because
the record lives in a settled blockchain transaction, its existence is bounded
above by the block time — a fact any observer can confirm independently. A
verifier needs only the transaction metadata, optionally the original content
bytes, and a public blockchain explorer; no issuer server is ever required.

## The five invariants

1. **Content-first** — the content hash is the primary claim; everything else is metadata about it.
2. **Issuer-agnostic** — any wallet can publish; verifiers never trust the publisher.
3. **Storage-agnostic** — content URIs are an optional plural list (`ar://`, `ipfs://`); hash-only records are valid.
4. **Standalone-verifiable** — a verifier needs only the transaction metadata, optionally the content bytes, and a public blockchain explorer. No issuer server is required at any step.
5. **Algorithm-agile** — hashes, AEADs, KEMs, KDFs, and signatures all reference named identifiers from extensible registries; post-quantum migration is additive.

## Verifying a proof

Standalone verifiability is the core promise: anyone can confirm a Label 309 proof
from public inputs alone. The standard defines three verifier roles, each a
superset of the previous:

- **Structural validator** — a pure function over the record's CBOR bytes. No I/O, no signature checks, no decryption. It answers a single question: is this a well-formed Label 309 record?
- **Public verifier** — fetches the transaction metadata, runs structural validation, and verifies any record-level signatures. It does not decrypt.
- **Recipient verifier** — a public verifier that additionally holds an X25519 private key, decrypts a sealed PoE, and recomputes the plaintext hashes.

## Repository layout

| Directory      | Purpose                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spec/`        | The normative standard prose — the authoritative definition of Label 309.                                   |
| `cddl/`        | The canonical CDDL grammar for the on-chain record (`label-309.cddl`).                                      |
| `schemas/`     | JSON Schemas for the record and its sub-structures.                                                         |
| `registries/`  | The extensible named-identifier registries: error codes and hash / KDF / signature / KEM / AEAD algorithms. |
| `conformance/` | Canonical cross-implementation test vectors — the byte-parity source of truth.                              |
| `examples/`    | Runnable reference implementations (`examples/typescript/`, `examples/python/`).                            |

Wire-format specifics — exact byte layouts, CBOR tags, field encodings — live in
`spec/`, `cddl/`, and `schemas/`, not in this README.

## Reference implementations

Reference tooling lives in sibling repositories within the same GitHub
organization. All three language SDKs are validated against the **same** canonical
conformance vectors in this repository, and produce **byte-identical** output for
the same inputs. That cross-implementation byte-parity is a core guarantee of the
standard.
